# Your Own Conversation Templates

What if you want to craft an AI Chat that knows _specifically_ about your conventions?
How cool would it be to have the answers in your own language?

You can craft your own conversation templates by adding `.json` files to the `.rubberduck/template` folder in your workspace. See the [custom templates in the Rubberduck repository for examples](https://github.com/rubberduck-ai/rubberduck-vscode/tree/main/.rubberduck/template).

To use custom conversations, run the "Rubberduck: Start Custom Chatâ€¦ ðŸ’¬" command.

Here is an example of a [drunken pirate describing your code](https://github.com/rubberduck-ai/rubberduck-vscode/blob/main/.rubberduck/template/describe-code-as-drunken-pirate.json):
