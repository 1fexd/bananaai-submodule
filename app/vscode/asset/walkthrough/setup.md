# Set Up Rubberduck

Rubberduck uses the OpenAI API and requires an API key to work. You can get an API key from [platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) (you'll need to sign up for an account).

Once you have an API key, enter it with the `Rubberduck: Enter OpenAI API key` command.
