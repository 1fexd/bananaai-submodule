**Continue is the leading open-source AI code assistant. You can connect any models and any context to build custom autocomplete and chat experiences inside [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue) and [JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22707-continue-extension)**
